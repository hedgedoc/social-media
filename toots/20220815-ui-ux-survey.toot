We need your support!

One of our goals in rebuilding #HedgeDoc, aside from accessibility and improved mobile device use, is to clean up the user interface.
Many of the old features are hidden or in unusual places. We don't even know if some of them are even used anymore. That's where you come in.

Please participate in the following anonymous user survey and share it with other HedgeDoc users.
This will help us a lot to make HedgeDoc 2 even better!
